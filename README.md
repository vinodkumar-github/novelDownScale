# Novel Image Scaling Algorithm

## Overview
A novel approach to image scaling with a primary focus on downscaling (with potential for upscaling through minor modifications). The algorithm utilizes harmonic data interpolation through the built-in Hypot method to achieve high-quality image transformation.

## Features
- Image downscaling with harmonic data interpolation
- Adaptable for upscaling with minimal modifications
- Utilizes the mathematical Hypot method for calculations
- Preserves image quality during transformation

## Getting Started
